# Tex & pandoc
## pandoc math highlight is broken in numbered lists, hard-wrapped lines
List itself is not broken. Because of the preceding 4 spaces, the line is recognized as a code block.
`let g:pandoc#syntax#protect#codeblocks = 0` fixes it.

## `gq` in pandoc lists is broken
Vim runs `undo_ftplugin` for pandoc because default `Filetype markdown` gets triggered at first `InsertEnter`.
This will reset several format-related settings, which breaks `gq` for markdown lists.
To fix this, manually reset all of the relevant settings in `Filetype pandoc`.

The root cause was lazy-loading ultisnip at InsertEnter. Removed the hack.


# TODO:
* Better interaction of `hlsearch` and conceal?
    * disable conceal when hlsearch set?
* git diff arbitrary commits inside nvim, diff mode usage, git-gutter,...
* sudoedit settings: undodir, ...
* `g]`-like commands can't be used in functions etc?
* fzf: make a feature request for ivy-like actions
* close all folds under the cursor (sub-tree) `zC` doesn't do this
* `<C-r><C-v>` to getvisual in cmap

    * "n", "N" (‚Üí `/_CTRL-G`, `/_CTRL-T`), "(", ")", "[[", "]]", "{", "}", "L", "H"
* Make prefix of built-in and user map time out <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12089482>.

* `debug-mode`?
* how to make `Gdiffsplit` do `--follow`?
* Textobj plugins can be lazy-loaded with manual `s:lod_map`

## Done
* Loading ultisnip at `InsertEnter` fires `FileType` again. Why?????
  This breaks non-idempotent operations at `FileType` like `AutoPairsDefine({}, ["'"])`
    * Just disable lazy load as it turns out that loading ultisnip isn't slow.
    * The root cause might be related to loading something that contains filetype plugin.
* Restore default `iskeyword` inside pandoc code block: it's impossible.
* width of unicode characters: Í∞Ä(2) vs ‚óØ(1)
    * ambiguous width characters
        * gnome-terminal -> compatibility -> ambiguous-width characters = wide, and `set ambiwidth=double`
        * how to do this in emacs?
        * too intrusive

  Maybe this is the only way to override autoload function. `:runtime` doesn't
  register the file as autoload file (?), so the file will be sourced again.

# things that I should make more use of
* marks
* `:global`
    * `:g/foo/z=3`
    * yank matching lines <https://stackoverflow.com/a/1475069>
* `zi`
* `i_CTRL-D`, `i_CTRL-T`, `i_CTRL-F`
* `:@`, `@:`
* `scroll-cursor`
* `g0`, `g$`, `g_`, `zH`, `zL`
* `g;`, `g,`
* `complete_CTRL-Y`, `complete_CTRL-E`
* `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`
* `/\C`
* `g<Tab>`
* `gJ`
* macros
    * `:h 10.1`
    * record ‚Üí (jump ‚Üí execute)*
    * If there's a *function* to jump (e.g. `gn`), the repetition step can be
      merged (e.g. `gn@@`) or jump can be part of the macro.
    * editing macros: use digraph to input control characters? <BS> is not ^H
* `g&`
* `g<`
* `_` without count is equivalent to `^`
* `i_CTRL-R_CTRL-` `R/O/P`
* surround `f/F/^F`
* grep + `:cdo s/../..`
* `:cabove`
* `backtick-expansion`

# pitfalls
* Cursor movement on concealed string: `set concealcursor=n` doesn't work as expected. <https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/4530/moving-over-conceal>
* `:h map-bar`
* Wrap `autocmd`s with `exec 'au ...'`: may not work as expected because of the interaction w/ `|`
* Matching `errorformat` may fail if the output from `:AsyncRun ...` is complex & quickfix is already open.
  Probably the output should be buffered.
* Terminals can't distinguish some keys e.g. `<ESC>` and `<C-[>`, .. . `<M-[>` is prefix of `<PageUp>`, ...
    * vim won't receive `<C-q>` if `<C-q>`,`<C-s>` is enabled in the terminal
* `<C-w>]` doesn't open in new tab if `switchbuf=useopen` which is useful for quickfix stuff.
* `<ESC>` is somewhat different from `CTRL-C`: c (`/`, `?`), i, v, ..
    * `i_CTRL-C` doesn't trigger `InsertLeave`!
* `<Up>` is slightly different from `<C-p>`
* after/indent doesn't work as expected?
* function without `return` returns 0. insert explicit `return ''` for side-effect only function for `<C-R>=` trick.
* `c_<C-R>_<C-W>`
  > With CTRL-W the part of the word that was already typed is not inserted again.

  That is not true if it's run manually (not from a mapping)????
* `=` does `C-indenting` when `equalprg` is not set
    * auto-pairs adds weird indent if the previous line ends with `,`. Indent size if the size of the first word in the previous line.
        * `<CR><C-c>O` (`nosmartindent`) vs. `<CR><C-c>=ko` (`&indentexpr != ''`)
* stuff highlighted as `Normal` -> bg doesn't match in floatwin
* lightline + cursorline + lazyredraw + large &lines = performance drop
* recording doesn't work well with async completion ‚Üí **TODO** `wildcharm`?
* `gq` internal formatting uses `indentexpr` (not documented?)
* `<C-k><space><space>` is non-break space! Can't disable with
    * `exe "digraph \<Space>\<Space> 32"`
    * `exe "inoremap \u00A0 <Space>"`
    * check patch 8.2.3184: cannot add a digraph with a leading space
* lightline
    * separator highlighting is optimized for fancy stuff like `'separator': { 'left': 'ÓÇ∞', 'right': 'ÓÇ≤' }, 'subseparator': { 'left': 'ÓÇ±', 'right': 'ÓÇ≥' }` ([issue](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim/issues/85)) ‚Üí using `' '` for separator results in some odd whitespaces
    * `component_expand` is not per-window
* `expand()` before passing to `filereadable()` (for `~`)
* `useopen` applies to `CTRL-W_CTRL-]` and `:sfind` etc but I only want it for quickfix commands.
* `formatexpr` and `indentexpr` silence errors
* ftplugin runs before other `au FileType` because the `filetype plugin indent on` is usually invoked before defining other autocmds (so the order is not built-in).
* `:filetype on` runs ftdetect scripts. So `runtimepath` should be set before `:filetype on`. If `SYS_VIMRC_FILE` runs `:syntax on` (which runs `:filetype on`), it should be reset by `:filetype off`.
  This is unnecessary for `:packadd`-based plugin management.

# (n)vim problem
* terminal reflow https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/2514
    * best: make it work like normal buffer with `nowrap`
    * running tmux inside the termianl:
        * reflow works but scrolling is broken
        * automation? maybe check `$VIM` in bashrc
* nvim creates empty undo when editorconfig TrimTrailingWhitespace is used (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/11987) (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11988)
* nvim's `CursorMoved` is differrent from vim's. This makes `vimtex_matchparen` wrongly hightlight fzf floatwin.
* shada merging bad https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/4295
    * impossible to wipe marks, registers, jumplist...
    * `:wshada!` https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/26540
* The line on which a three-piece comment's start/end piece lies is treated specially by `gq`. Not documented in fo-table 'q'. Related? <https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/1696>.
    * These lines are not joined properly by `gq`.
      ```coq
      (* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor
      invidunt
      *)
      (* Lorem
      ipsum
      *)
      (* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor
      invidunt *)
      ```
    * `formatlistpat` is not properly applied if the visual block contains the first line
      ```coq
      (* Lorem
      - ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat,
      *)
      ```
* treesitter
    * sometimes both vim syntax and treesitter hightlighting are on
    * breaks `<cword>`?
* https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14298
  Similar issue in vim without tmux when mapping `<M-]>`.
  `vim --clean -c 'map <ESC>] <M-]>'` to reproduce.
* previewheight is ignored if pedit is run on window with
  `vim --clean`, `set lines=74`
  ```
  wincmd s | wincmd j | set wfh | exe "norm! z13\<CR>" | pedit file
  wincmd s | wincmd j | set wfh | exe "norm! z14\<CR>" | pedit file
  ```
* In diff mode, editing in insert mode keeps moving the view. Triggered by `<CR>` and inserting a character for the first time after the last `<CR>` or entering the insert mode. Not related to `set diffopt+=algorithm:histogram,indent-heuristic`.
