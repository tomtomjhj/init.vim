# Tex & pandoc
## pandoc math highlight is broken in numbered lists, hard-wrapped lines
List itself is not broken. Because of the preceding 4 spaces, the line is recognized as a code block.
`let g:pandoc#syntax#protect#codeblocks = 0` fixes it.

## `gq` in pandoc lists is broken
Vim runs `undo_ftplugin` for pandoc because default `Filetype markdown` gets triggered at first `InsertEnter`.
This will reset several format-related settings, which breaks `gq` for markdown lists.
To fix this, manually reset all of the relevant settings in `Filetype pandoc`.

The root cause was lazy-loading ultisnip at InsertEnter. Removed the hack.


# TODO:
* Better interaction of `hlsearch` and conceal?
    * disable conceal when hlsearch set?
* git diff arbitrary commits inside nvim, diff mode usage, git-gutter,...
* sudoedit settings: undodir, ...
* `g]`-like commands can't be used in functions etc?
* fzf: make a feature request for ivy-like actions
* close all folds under the cursor (sub-tree) `zC` doesn't do this
* `<C-r><C-v>` to getvisual in cmap
* better 'paragraph'
    * markdown list
* fzf preview: <S-down> slow -> key code Î∂ÑÌï¥Îê®
* make repetitive jump commands' jumplist modification behave like `sneak-clever-s`
    * "n", "N", "(", ")", "[[", "]]", "{", "}", "L", "H"
* Make prefix of built-in and user map time out <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12089482>. 
  ```vim

* make ùì• a word char? <https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/d489c9801b3aaf284d42643507bbfb9ce3bc0f2f>
    * if spellcheck is the problem, do something similar to `set spelllang=cjk`
* multiple clients for single nvim instance? good for multi-monitor setup. <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/2161>
* bullet list block textobj, somewhat similar to haskell layout rule
* `/` without moving cursor
* custom command modifier? (`<mods>`) for smart splitting based on current window layout

## Done
* Loading ultisnip at `InsertEnter` fires `FileType` again. Why?????
  This breaks non-idempotent operations at `FileType` like `AutoPairsDefine({}, ["'"])`
    * Just disable lazy load as it turns out that loading ultisnip isn't slow.
    * The root cause might be related to loading something that contains filetype plugin.
* Restore default `iskeyword` inside pandoc code block: it's impossible.
* width of unicode characters: Í∞Ä(2) vs ‚óØ(1)
    * ambiguous width characters
        * gnome-terminal -> compatibility -> ambiguous-width characters = wide, and `set ambiwidth=double`
        * how to do this in emacs?
        * too intrusive

    ```vim
    " .vim/plugin/sneak/util.vim

    ```
  Maybe this is the only way to override autoload function. `:runtime` doesn't
  register the file as autoload file (?), so the file will be sourced again.

# things that I should make more use of
* marks
* `:global`
    * `:g/foo/z=3`
    * yank matching lines <https://stackoverflow.com/a/1475069>
* `zi`
* `i_CTRL-D`, `i_CTRL-T`, `i_CTRL-F`
* `:@`, `@:`
* `scroll-cursor`
* `g0`, `g$`, `g_`, `zH`, `zL`
* `g;`, `g,`
* `complete_CTRL-Y`, `complete_CTRL-E`
* `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`
* `/\C`
* `g<Tab>`
* `gJ`
* macros
    * `:h 10.1`
    * record ‚Üí (jump ‚Üí execute)*
    * If there's a *function* to jump (e.g. `gn`), the repetition step can be
      merged (e.g. `gn@@`) or jump can be part of the macro.
    * editing macros: use digraph to input control characters? <BS> is not ^H
* `g&`
* `g<`
* `_` without count is equivalent to `^`

# pitfalls
* Cursor movement on concealed string: `set concealcursor=n` doesn't work as expected. <https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/4530/moving-over-conceal>
* `:h map-bar`
* Wrap `autocmd`s with `exec 'au ...'`: may not work as expected because of the interaction w/ `|`
* Matching `errorformat` may fail if the output from `:AsyncRun ...` is complex & quickfix is already open.
  Probably the output should be buffered.
* Terminals can't distinguish some keys e.g. `<ESC>` and `<C-[>`, .. . `<M-[>` is prefix of `<PageUp>`, ...
    * vim won't receive `<C-q>` if `<C-q>`,`<C-s>` is enabled in the terminal
* `inoremap <C-w> <C-R>=execute("norm db")<CR><C-R>=col('.')==col('$')-1?"\<lt>C-G>U\<lt>Right>":""<CR>`
  This still breaks undo after ins-special-special and is still broken at the line end.
* `<C-w>]` doesn't open in new tab if `switchbuf=useopen` which is useful for quickfix stuff.
* `<ESC>` is somewhat different from `CTRL-C`: c (`/`, `?`), i, v, ..
    * `i_CTRL-C` doesn't trigger `InsertLeave`!
* `<Up>` is slightly different from `<C-p>`
* after/indent doesn't work as expected?
* function without `return` returns 0. insert explicit `return ''` for side-effect only function for `<C-R>=` trick.
* `c_<C-R>_<C-W>`
  > With CTRL-W the part of the word that was already typed is not inserted again.

  That is not true if it's run manually (not from a mapping)????
* `=` does `C-indenting` when `equalprg` is not set
    * auto-pairs adds weird indent if the previous line ends with `,`. Indent size if the size of the first word in the previous line.
        * `<CR><C-c>O` (`nosmartindent`) vs. `<CR><C-c>=ko` (`&indentexpr != ''`)
* stuff highlighted as `Normal` -> bg doesn't match in floatwin
* lightline + cursorline + lazyredraw + large &lines = performance drop
* recording doesn't work well with async completion
* `gq` internal formatting uses `indentexpr` (not documented?)


# (n)vim problem
* terminal reflow https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/2514
    * best: make it work like normal buffer with `nowrap`
    * running tmux inside the termianl:
        * reflow works but scrolling is broken
        * automation? maybe check `$VIM` in bashrc
* nvim lsp, completion performance?
    * need some kind of delay before doing something
    * <https://github.com/nvim-lua/completion-nvim/issues/203>, <https://github.com/nvim-lua/completion-nvim/issues/231>
    * https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/13049
* nvim creates empty undo when editorconfig TrimTrailingWhitespace is used (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/11987) (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11988)
* nvim's `CursorMoved` is differrent from vim's. This makes `vimtex_matchparen` wrongly hightlight fzf floatwin.
* showbreak breaks many things: blockwise paste, ..?
* copying window-local variables on split is not synchronous??
* jumplist is crazy
    ```vim
    0
    let [lnum, col] = searchpos('^\s*\zsProof\.', 'cnW')
    while lnum
        " this creates jumps????
        exe lnum
        exe 'normal! ' . col . '|'
        normal zf%
        normal! $
        let [lnum, col] = searchpos('^\s*\zsProof\.', 'cnW')
        " This prevents creating jumps ???????
        ju
