# Tex & pandoc
## pandoc math highlight is broken in numbered lists, hard-wrapped lines
List itself is not broken. Because of the preceding 4 spaces, the line is recognized as a code block.
`let g:pandoc#syntax#protect#codeblocks = 0` fixes it.

## `gq` in pandoc lists is broken
Vim runs `undo_ftplugin` for pandoc because default `Filetype markdown` gets triggered at first `InsertEnter`.
This will reset several format-related settings, which breaks `gq` for markdown lists.
To fix this, manually reset all of the relevant settings in `Filetype pandoc`.

The root cause was lazy-loading ultisnip at InsertEnter. Removed the hack.

## Done
* Loading ultisnip at `InsertEnter` fires `FileType` again. Why?????
  This breaks non-idempotent operations at `FileType` like `AutoPairsDefine({}, ["'"])`
    * Just disable lazy load as it turns out that loading ultisnip isn't slow.
    * The root cause might be related to loading something that contains filetype plugin.
* Restore default `iskeyword` inside pandoc code block: it's impossible.
* width of unicode characters: Í∞Ä(2) vs ‚óØ(1)
    * ambiguous width characters
        * gnome-terminal -> compatibility -> ambiguous-width characters = wide, and `set ambiwidth=double`
        * how to do this in emacs?

## Colorscheme customization
* Context: highlight = syntax (`syntax/`, `after/syntax/`) + colorscheme (`:colorscheme`, `au ColorScheme`).
    * Syntax definition includes the default highlight links.
      A default link should point to a syntactic group e.g. builtin groups like `Statement`.
      This also applies to overriding a default link.
      If users do not like a default link, they should override the default link in `after/syntax/`.
    * ColorScheme definition links syntax groups to a color group (or give a color to the syntax group).
      If users want to change highlight of a syntax group when this specific colorscheme is active, they should override the current link in `au ColorScheme`.
    * NOTE: `FileType` and `ftplugin/` is not a right place to do any customization because `:syn-include` does not know it.
* Problem: There is no way to modify the default highlight link ONLY.
    * `hi def link` has no effect if the default link is already set.
    * `hi! def link` always overrides the current link.
      So `hi! def link` in `after/syntax/` may override `:hi! link` customizations done in `ColorScheme`.
* Desired:
  `hi! def link` should override the current link only if the current link is the same with the default link.
  This is useful for customizing syntax/highlight without affecting/being affected by
  colorschemes that have their own customizations.
* Workaround:
    * ‚úó At the end of `after/syntax/` (after all `hi! def link`s), source the current colorscheme, and `doautocmd <nomodeline> ColorScheme`.
      The end result is the same, but doesn't sound like a good idea..
    * ‚úó Set up a `au ColorSchemePre *` that runs `hi! def link`s?
      `hi clear` changes the behavior of subsequent `hi def link`.
      This is clearly a bug.
      ```
      syn keyword Group word
      hi def link Group Todo
      hi clear
      hi def link Group Comment
      " "word" is highlighted as Comment
      " if hi clear is run again, "word" is highlighted as Todo
      ```
    * ‚úó `hi clear Group` and then `hi def link`?
      `hi clear` does not clear the default link.
    * ‚úó `hi def link Group NONE` and then `hi def link`?
      Clears the current link, but
      doesn't clear the default link and the subsequent `hi def link` (without `hi clear` in between) has no effect at all, ending up with no current highlight.
    * ‚úó `hi! def link Group NONE` and then `hi def link`.
      Overrides the default link, but following `hi clear` and `hi def link` overrides the current link (but not the default link, like above).
    * ‚úó Set up a `au ColorScheme *` that runs `hi! def link`s.
      It overrides the default link and is not affected by `hi clear`.
      However, it may override the links of the colorscheme, which should be re-overridden in another `au ColorScheme`.
      Quite ugly.
    * ‚úì In `after/syntax/`, put `hi! def link`. Make a function that does per-colorscheme `hi! link`. Immediately call this function and register it to `au ColorScheme`.

# pitfalls
* Cursor movement on concealed string: `set concealcursor=n` doesn't work as expected. <https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/4530/moving-over-conceal>
* `:h map-bar`
* Wrap `autocmd`s with `exec 'au ...'`: may not work as expected because of the interaction w/ `|`
* Matching `errorformat` may fail if the output from `:AsyncRun ...` is complex & quickfix is already open.
  Probably the output should be buffered.
* Terminals can't distinguish some keys e.g. `<ESC>` and `<C-[>`, .. . `<M-[>` is prefix of `<PageUp>`, ...
    * vim won't receive `<C-q>` if `<C-q>`,`<C-s>` is enabled in the terminal
* `<C-w>]` doesn't open in new tab if `switchbuf=useopen` which is useful for quickfix stuff.
* `<ESC>` is somewhat different from `CTRL-C`: c (`/`, `?`), i, v, ..
    * `i_CTRL-C` doesn't trigger `InsertLeave`!
* `<Up>` is slightly different from `<C-p>`
* after/indent doesn't work as expected?
* function without `return` returns 0. insert explicit `return ''` for side-effect only function for `<C-R>=` trick.
* `c_<C-R>_<C-W>`
  > With CTRL-W the part of the word that was already typed is not inserted again.

  That is not true if it's run manually (not from a mapping)????
* `=` does `C-indenting` when `equalprg` is not set
    * auto-pairs adds weird indent if the previous line ends with `,`. Indent size if the size of the first word in the previous line.
        * `<CR><C-c>O` (`nosmartindent`) vs. `<CR><C-c>=ko` (`&indentexpr != ''`)
* stuff highlighted as `Normal` -> bg doesn't match in floatwin
* lightline + cursorline + lazyredraw + large &lines = performance drop
* recording doesn't work well with async completion ‚Üí **TODO** `wildcharm`?
* `gq` internal formatting uses `indentexpr` (not documented?)
* `<C-k><space><space>` is non-break space! Can't disable with
    * `exe "digraph \<Space>\<Space> 32"`
    * `exe "inoremap \u00A0 <Space>"`
    * check patch 8.2.3184: cannot add a digraph with a leading space
* lightline
    * separator highlighting is optimized for fancy stuff like `'separator': { 'left': 'ÓÇ∞', 'right': 'ÓÇ≤' }, 'subseparator': { 'left': 'ÓÇ±', 'right': 'ÓÇ≥' }` ([issue](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim/issues/85)) ‚Üí using `' '` for separator results in some odd whitespaces
    * `component_expand` is not per-window
* `expand()` before passing to `filereadable()` (for `~`)
* `useopen` applies to `CTRL-W_CTRL-]` and `:sfind` etc but I only want it for quickfix commands.
* `formatexpr` and `indentexpr` silence errors
* ftplugin runs before other `au FileType` because the `filetype plugin indent on` is usually invoked before defining other autocmds (so the order is not built-in).
* `:filetype on` runs ftdetect scripts. So `runtimepath` should be set before `:filetype on`. If `SYS_VIMRC_FILE` runs `:syntax on` (which runs `:filetype on`), it should be reset by `:filetype off`.
  This is unnecessary for `:packadd`-based plugin management.
* If `lazyredraw` is set, entering cmdline-mode with a mapping doesn't update the statusline.
    * Manually: `noremap <C-g> :<C-u>Grep <Cmd>redrawstatus<CR>`
    * `redrawstatus` on `CmdlineEnter`: Mappings that enter&exit cmdline mode also trigger this. Must use `<Cmd>`.
* vim-plug can't lazy-load lua plugins.
    * issues
        * `plug#load` only sources `.vim` files. <https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/issues/65>
        * Order of `setup()` and `plugin/*.lua` sourcing?
    * impatient.nvim makes lua plugin startup fast enough.

# (n)vim issues

    * running tmux inside the termianl:
        * reflow works but scrolling is broken
        * automation? maybe check `$VIM` in bashrc
* nvim's `CursorMoved` is differrent from vim's. This makes `vimtex_matchparen` wrongly highlight fzf floatwin.

    * impossible to wipe marks, registers, jumplist...
    * `:wshada!` https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/26540
    * Edit shada, `:rshada!`, exit.
* The line on which a three-piece comment's start/end piece lies is treated specially by `gq`. Not documented in fo-table 'q'. Related? <https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/1696>.
    * These lines are not joined properly by `gq`.

  Similar issue in vim without tmux when mapping `<M-]>`.
  `vim --clean -c 'map <ESC>] <M-]>'` to reproduce.
* previewheight is ignored if pedit is run on window with
  `vim --clean`, `set lines=74`
  ```
  wincmd s | wincmd j | set wfh | exe "norm! z13\<CR>" | pedit file
  wincmd s | wincmd j | set wfh | exe "norm! z14\<CR>" | pedit file
  ```
* gvim clears clipboard when exiting??
* `hi def link` + `hi clear` is somewhat broken
* nvim: If there's a mapping that starts with `<C-c>` in current mode (but not exactly `<C-c>`), `<C-c>` does not interrupt vimscript (loop, `:sleep`, ...). <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/15258>
* When typing a prefix of imap, the typed char is displayed during the timeout. Is this intended?

## ...
* `ge` ... design of inclusive/exclusive stuff
* `^` vs `0`
* `Y`
* `n`, `;` is relative
* `whichwrap` option. Why not absolute commands?
* `backspace=nostop` is not default
* no command for deleting whitespace block

## wishlist
* timeout for built-in multi-char commands so that it doesn't interfere with user mappings
* character classes (like emacs); word ‚â† identifier
